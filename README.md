# Linear Algebra Pamphlet
This is a repository containing my pamphlet regarding Linear Algebra course held by Prof. Gilbert Strang at MIT. I wrote this pamphlet while auditing the course [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL49CF3715CB9EF31D).

You can find my pamphlet in my google drive using [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BNRlFmZMztHuKTYWtbzTDqWknPoOMrOq/view?usp=sharing).

This pamphlet will be completed and updated soon.
